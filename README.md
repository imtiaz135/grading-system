Project Title

Python Fundamentals: Decision Making, Loops, Functions, and Error Handling

Project Overview

This project is designed to help beginners understand the core concepts of Python programming through theory explanations and practical exercises. It focuses on decision-making, loops, functions, and basic error handling using real-life examples. By completing this project, learners gain confidence in writing simple yet meaningful Python programs.

Objectives

Understand how Python makes decisions using if-else statements

Learn how to compare values using comparison operators

Practice repeating tasks using loops

Create reusable code using functions

Handle basic errors to make programs more reliable

Apply concepts to real-life scenarios

Theory Concepts
1. If-Else Statements

If-else statements allow a program to make decisions based on conditions. The program executes different blocks of code depending on whether a condition is true or false.

Example use case:
Checking if a student has passed or failed based on marks

2. Comparison Operators

Comparison operators are used to compare two values and return a boolean result (True or False).

Common operators:
Equal to (==)
Not equal to (!=)
Greater than (>)
Less than (<)
Greater than or equal to (>=)
Less than or equal to (<=)

These operators are mainly used in conditions.

3. For Loops

For loops are used to repeat a block of code a fixed number of times. They are useful when the number of repetitions is known.

Example use case:
Printing numbers from 1 to 100

4. While Loops

While loops repeat a block of code as long as a condition remains true. They are useful when the number of repetitions is not known in advance.

Example use case:
Asking the user for valid input until correct data is entered

5. Functions

Functions are reusable blocks of code that perform a specific task. They help reduce repetition and make programs easier to understand and maintain.

Example use case:
Calculating the area of a rectangle multiple times

6. Basic Error Handling

Error handling helps manage unexpected inputs or runtime errors. It prevents the program from crashing and allows graceful handling of mistakes.

Example use case:
Handling non-numeric input in a calculator program

Hands-On Practice Programs
1. Time-Based Greeting Program

A program that displays different messages depending on the time of day (morning, afternoon, evening, night) using if-else statements.

2. Number Guessing Game

A simple game where the user guesses a number, and the program provides feedback using if-else logic.

3. Print Numbers from 1 to 100

A program that uses a for loop to print numbers from 1 to 100 automatically.

4. Area of Rectangle Function

A function that calculates the area of a rectangle using length and width provided by the user.

Formula used:
Area = length × width

5. Simple Calculator

A calculator program that performs:
Addition
Subtraction
Multiplication
Division

This program uses functions and basic error handling.

6. Real-Life Scenario Programs

Grading system based on student marks
Age category classification (child, teenager, adult, senior citizen)

Setup and Installation

Install Python from the official Python website

Open a terminal or command prompt

Run the program using:
python filename.py

What I Learned

Through this project, I learned how to:

Write decision-making logic using if-else

Use loops to automate repeated tasks

Create and use functions effectively

Handle user input errors gracefully

Apply Python concepts to real-life problems

Conclusion

This project strengthened my understanding of Python fundamentals and improved my ability to solve problems logically. It serves as a strong foundation for learning advanced programming concepts in the future.
